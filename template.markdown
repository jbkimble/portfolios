# (Jonathan Kimble) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn as much as possible about the ruby programming language and object oriented programming.  I wanted to integrate myself into the turing community, bond with my cohort, and learn about and give back to the community.
