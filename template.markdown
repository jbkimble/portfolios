# (Jonathan Kimble) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn as much as possible about the ruby programming language and object oriented programming.  I wanted to integrate myself into the turing community, bond with my cohort, and learn about and give back to the community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My two individual projects 

#### (Date Night)
* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/date_night
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

Description: In date night we worked with binary search trees and the ability to insert into a binary search tree, tell the depth of a specific node, find the depth of a node, and return the minumum node and the maximum node

Evaluation comments:
* not full functionality, starting on sort method
* good separation of responsibilities
* consistent use of recursion across all methods, doesnt waffle back to looping

1. Functional Expectations
*1: Application is missing more than one base expectation
2. Test-Driven Development
*3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
*4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
*3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Looping or Recursion
*3.5: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### (Event Reporter)

* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/event_reporter
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1608-b/event_reporter.markdown

Description:

Notes:

*12 tests
*Pull out CSV stuff
*overall good. Sweet use of emojis
*Dont have messages puts, have module return just the text and print on the outside to test
*District info is gotten but is not saved to the attendee objects, and therefore is not included in CSV or html export

Evaluation Scores:

1. Functional Expectations
  * 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
2. REPL Interface
 * 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
3. Test-Driven Development
 * 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
6. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques
7. HTML and Style
*3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.
