# (Jonathan Kimble) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn as much as possible about the ruby programming language and object oriented programming.  I wanted to integrate myself into the turing community, bond with my cohort, and learn about and give back to the community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My two individual projects 

#### Date Night
* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/date_night
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

Description: In date night we worked with binary search trees and the ability to insert into a binary search tree, tell the depth of a specific node, and return the minimum node and the maximum node.  It was a challenging project that required us to learn about basic data structures.  During this project I learned more about how to breakdown and tackle hard problems and apply recursion.  It greatly increased my confidence in my programming ability.

Evaluation comments:
* not full functionality, starting on sort method
* good separation of responsibilities
* consistent use of recursion across all methods, doesnt waffle back to looping

Evaluation Scores:

1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

3.5: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event Reporter

* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/event_reporter
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown

Description: In event reported we worked with csv files and a REPL interface.  We learned about searching through csv data, building methods, and outputting or results to various file types.
 
Evaluation comments:
* 12 tests
* Pull out CSV stuff
* overall good. Sweet use of emojis
* Dont have messages puts, have module return just the text and print on the outside to test
* District info is gotten but is not saved to the attendee objects, and therefore is not included in CSV or html export

Evaluation Scores:

2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are both of my group projects. These projects were an opportunity to work on my pairing and teamworks skills as well as expand my ability to solve problems with ruby.   I enjoyed working with a team and putting our heads together on a problem. I learned more about my own working style, areas of strength, and how to approach a problem in a way that leads to success.

#### Enigma

* Github URL: https://github.com/mscherer11/enigma-copy
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

Description: In this project we built a virtual enigma machine to encrypt, crack, and decrypt messages

Evaluation comments:
* test coverage is sparse
* separation of responsibilities is done well
* crack method was not complete
* did use 127 character alphabet using ascii map

Evaluation Scores:
* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### HeadCount

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/JStans12/headcount
* Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

Description: In this project we create a program that allows us to load multiple csv files with data about colorado school districts and draw relationships between the data.

## D: Professional Skills
At Turing there is an emphasis in devloping proffesional skills as well as technical skills.  Proffesional skills help us find longterm success in the industry, be more effective, and give back to our communities.  They are an important part of the Turing curiculum.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

Takeaways from the session:

In order to learn rapidlly there are several things to keep in mind: First don't try to learn every aspect of a new skill at once, instead break down problems into small chunks and master one tiny piece at a time before moving onto the next.  It is also vital to maintain growth mindset and a calm learning state of mind even in the face of difficult material, with repeated practice you can learn material that seemed impossible at first.  One way to accelerate your learning is to expose youself repeatedly to lots of good examples of what you are trying to learn.  Finally community is an important part of learning and in order to reach your full potential you must surround yourself with the best and learn from the best.

#### There Is An "I" In Team

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown

Takeaways from the session:

In this session we learned about the importantance of setting boundaries in a team project and to respect the boundaries of your team mates.  In order to be the best teammate possible it is important to be compassionate and recognize the humanity of your teammates, even if it doesn't appear so everyone is doing their best and you should see things from their viewpoint and support them in whatever way is necessary to bring out their best selves.
During discussion we touch on several reasons that lead to problems amoung teams and how to minimize these issues: different communication styles, work flow, and skill gaps between team members seemed to be the most common problems faced by teams. To mitigate these challenges Completing a DTR is super important, also set yourself up for open communication and address any problems in a respectful way as soon as your notice them.

#### (Session Name)

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

Takeaways from the session:

* There are far fewer women in the tech industry than men and this takes away teams and the products they create
* Because of the male dominated culuture it can lead to institutionalized sexism and further push women and minorities away from the industry
* Be mindful of others and how to make them feel comfortable in a space
* Take agency in creating an inclusive and diverse tech community (let everyone know that tech is for them and they can succeed here)


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Defining the Relationship

* Workshop URL: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W64y2vBOrd6hVyHEvFKwtMgQvuHIgkOzngHrDt4JwEQ/edit?usp=sharing
* Link to Completed Deliverables: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMRbrQ63JgPOkidjxzaTVFMhmLJj_cQa12HxZ7Ydkfk/edit?usp=sharing
* 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xxa41ZXtwoKrqljOrrLzs4pdGKw-8J4e8WQlbrafH1U/edit?usp=sharing

Takeaways:
* It is important to define the relationship at the start of any sort of team work, this sets expectations, brings up any potential difficulties, and allows the team to figure out how to communicate and work best together
* Have regular follow up DTR's.  Open communication is key.
* Take agency in upholding the expectations that are set and ensuring the team works well together
