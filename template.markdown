# (Jonathan Kimble) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn as much as possible about the ruby programming language and object oriented programming.  I wanted to integrate myself into the turing community, bond with my cohort, and learn about and give back to the community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My two individual projects 

#### Date Night
* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/date_night
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

Description: In date night we worked with binary search trees and the ability to insert into a binary search tree, tell the depth of a specific node, find the depth of a node, and return the minimum node and the maximum node.  It was a challenging project that required us to learn about basic data structures.  Through this project I learned more about how to breakdown and tackle hard problems and apply recursion.  It greatly increased my confidence in my programming ability.

Evaluation comments:
* not full functionality, starting on sort method
* good separation of responsibilities
* consistent use of recursion across all methods, doesnt waffle back to looping

Evaluation Scores:

1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

3.5: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### (Event Reporter)

* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/event_reporter
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown

Description: In event reported we worked with csv files and a REPL interface.  We learned about searching through csv data, building methods, and outputting or results to various file types.
 
Evaluation comments:
* 12 tests
* Pull out CSV stuff
* overall good. Sweet use of emojis
* Dont have messages puts, have module return just the text and print on the outside to test
* District info is gotten but is not saved to the attendee objects, and therefore is not included in CSV or html export

Evaluation Scores:

2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are both of my group projects. These projects were an opportunity to work on my pairing and teamworks skills as well as expand my ability to solve problems with ruby.   I enjoyed working with a team and putting our heads together on a problem. I learned more about my own working style, areas of strength, and how to approach a problem in a way that leads to success.

#### Enigma

* Github URL: https://github.com/mscherer11/enigma-copy
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

Description: In this project we built a virtual enigma machine to encrypt, crack, and decrypt messages

Evaluation comments:
* test coverage is sparse
* separation of responsibilities is done well
* crack method was not complete
* did use 127 character alphabet using ascii map

Evaluation Scores:
* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


Feedback To Me:

#### (HeadCount)

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/JStans12/headcount
* Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

Description: In this project we create a program that allows us to load multiple csv files with data about colorado school districts and draw relationships between the data.
